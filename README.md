# flu-vaccine-sieve

This project aims to detect differences in circulating clade frequencies among populations with different vaccine coverages.

Each directory contains scripts, plots, and data necessary to generate the analysis in 'Estimating vaccine-driven selection in seasonal influenza.'

ILI and subtype frequency surveillance data are retrieved from the WHO FluNet (http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/flunet/en/) and FluID (http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/fluid/en/) databases.
